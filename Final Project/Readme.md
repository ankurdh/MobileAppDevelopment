ANDROID APPLICATION NAME - HUDKU
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HUDKU (means "Search" in Indian Language: Kannada)

APPLICATION CATEGORY
-----------------------
Social Networking, Review Applications.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
---------------------------
This project aims to provide integrated review sets and deals from various review sites, such as Yelp, Google Places, Foursquare, City Search. The inception for this proposal comes from constant usage of "Review Apps".
While using certain Android Apps, we always wondered, would it be possible to display review contents from different Review Sites(like Yelp, Foursquare to name a few) which would benefit the App User from opening 3 to 4 review sites?
With the GPS location of the phone we plan to gather data from the nearby restaurants in 50 meter radius. The gathered data will be in a presentable UI, which will display 1-2 top-most reviews from each of the Review sites. If the Review sites have any restaurant deals or offers to give away, they will be displayed as well.
Present day consumers use the reviews provided by these Review Apps in most scenarios. If consumers are looking for reviews on the go and want to stop by a new place, HUDKU would serve well to the consumer.
